This is code associated with the submitted manuscript:

Quantifying cell densities and biovolumes of phytoplankton communities and functional groups using scanning flow cytometry, machine learning and unsupervised clustering

Mridul K. Thomas, Simone Fontana, Marta Reyes & Francesco Pomati

The code applies to example dataset, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.977773. The input and output of every step is shown. However, it may be readily adapted for rapid analysis of data from any non-imaging flow cytometer or scanning flow cytometer. 

Please note that where data subsets were generated (Script 3 and Script 5), the example files were generated from a larger set of data files which are not presented here because they did not have associated microscopy measurements.
